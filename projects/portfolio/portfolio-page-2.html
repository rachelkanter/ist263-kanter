                    <img src="./images/branding.jpg" alt="Branding Project">
                <p>The Branding Project was teaching us about how to work with a client and tailor logos, fonts and other styling elements to the client. I was assigned Edgar Allan Poe. One of Poe's most famous poems is "The Raven." The logo features the Raven as well as the profile of a man, showing how Poe is intertwined with his life's work. The fonts and other elements were intended to show the creepy and mysterious nature of Poe and his work.</p>

                <p>The final project in VIS 207 was to create our own magazine. I based my magazine on fall food. The assignment called for a magazine cover, an opening spread and the article page which were all designed by me.</p>
