            <p>Echelon is a company that my advertising group came up with for my ADV 206 class. Echelon is an app that provides runners with an experience. The purpose of this project was to teach the class about all the steps to an advertising campaign. Besides for creating the product and the rationale behind why this app is missing on the market, we created ads to showcase this app.</p>
